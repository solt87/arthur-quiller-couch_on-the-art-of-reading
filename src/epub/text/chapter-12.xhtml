<p>I do not think, Gentlemen, that we need to bother ourselves today
with any definition of a 'classic,' or of the <i>stigmata</i> by which
a true classic can be recognised. Sainte-Beuve once indicated
these in a famous discourse, "Qu'est-ce qu'un classique": and it
may suffice us that these include Universality and Permanence.
Your true classic is <i>universal,</i> in that it appeals to the
catholic mind of man. It is doubly <i>permanent</i>: for it remains
significant, or acquires a new significance, after the age for
which it was written and the conditions under which it was
written, have passed away; and it yet keeps, undefaced by
handling, the original noble imprint of the mind that first
minted it—or shall we say that, as generation after generation
rings the coin, it ever returns the echo of its father-spirit?</p>

<p>But for our purpose it suffices that in our literature we possess
a number of works to which the title of classic cannot be
refused. So let us confine ourselves to these, and to the
question, How to use them?</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-2"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>

<p>Well, to begin with, I revert to a point which I tried to
establish in my first lecture; and insist with all my strength
that the first obligation we owe to any classic, and to those
whom we teach, and to ourselves, is to treat it <i>absolutely</i>: not
for any secondary or derivative purpose, or purpose recommended
as useful by any manual: but at first solely to interpret the
meaning which its author intended: that in short we should
<i>trust</i> any given masterpiece for its operation, on ourselves and
on others. In that first lecture I quoted to you this most wise
sentence:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  That all spirit is mutually attractive, as all matter is
  mutually attractive, is an ultimate fact,</p>

<p>and consenting to this with all my heart I say that it matters
very little for the moment, or even for a considerable while,
that a pupil does not perfectly, or even nearly, understand all
he reads, provided we can get the attraction to seize upon him.
He and the author between them will do the rest: our function is
to communicate and trust. In what other way do children take the
ineffaceable stamp of a gentle nurture than by daily attraction
to whatsoever is beautiful and amiable and dignified in their
home? As there, so in their reading, the process must be gradual
of acquiring an inbred monitor to reject the evil and choose the
good. For it is the property of masterpieces that they not only
raise you to</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6%; margin-right: 6%">     despise low joys, low Gains;
     Disdain whatever Cornbury disdains:</p>

<p>they are not only as Lamb wrote of the Plays of Shakespeare
'enrichers of the fancy, strengtheners of virtue, a withdrawing
from all selfish and mercenary thoughts, a lesson of all sweet
and honourable thoughts and actions, to teach you courtesy,
benignity, generosity, humanity'; but they raise your gorge to
defend you from swallowing the fifth-rate, the sham, the
fraudulent. <i>Abeunt studia in mores.</i> I cannot, for my part,
conceive a man who has once incorporated the "Phaedo" or the
"Paradiso" or "Lear" in himself as lending himself for a moment
to one or other of the follies plastered in these late stern
times upon the firm and most solid purpose of this nation—the
inanities, let us say, of a Baby-Week. Or, for a more damnable
instance, I think of you and me with Marvell's great Horatian Ode
sunk in our minds, standing to-day by the statue of Charles I
that looks down Whitehall: telling ourselves of 'that memorable
scene' before the Banqueting House, remembering amid old woes all
the glory of our blood and state, recollecting what is due even
to ourselves, standing on the greatest site of our capital, and
turning to see it degraded, as it has been for a week, to a
vulgar raree-show. Gentlemen, I could read you many poor
ill-written letters from mothers whose sons have died for England,
to prove to you we have not deserved <i>that,</i> or the sort of placard
with which London has been plastered,</p>

<p>     Dum domus Æneae Capitoli immobile saxum<br/>

     Accolet.<br/>
</p>

<p>Great enterprises (as we know) and little minds go ill together.<br/>

Someone veiled the statue. That, at least, was well done.<br/>
</p>

<p>I have not the information—nor do I want it—to make even a
guess who was responsible for this particular outrage. I know the
sort of man well enough to venture that he never had a liberal
education, and, further, that he is probably rather proud of
it. But he may nevertheless own some instinct of primitive
kindliness: and I wish he could know how he afflicts men of
sensitiveness who have sons at the War.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-3"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>

<p>Secondly, let us consider what use we can make of even one
selected classic. I refer you back to the work of an old
schoolmaster, quoted in my first lecture:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I believe, if the truth were known, men would be astonished at
  the small amount of learning with which a high degree of
  culture is compatible. In a moment of enthusiasm I ventured
  once to tell my 'English set' that if they could really master
  the ninth book of "Paradise Lost," so as to rise to the height
  of its great argument and incorporate all its beauties in
  themselves, they would at one blow, by virtue of that alone,
  become highly cultivated men…. More and more various learning
  might raise them to the same height by different paths, but
  could hardly raise them higher.</p>

<p>I beg your attention for the exact words: 'to rise to the height
of its great argument and <i>incorporate all its beauties in
themselves.</i>' There you have it—'to incorporate.' Do you
remember that saying of Wordsworth's, casually dropped in
conversation, but preserved for us by Hazlitt?—'It is in the
highest degree unphilosophic to call language or diction the
dress of our thoughts…. It is the <i>incarnation</i> of our
thoughts.' Even so, I maintain to you, the first business of a
learner in literature is to get complete hold of some undeniable
masterpiece and incorporate it, incarnate it. And, I repeat,
there are a few great works for you to choose from: works
approved for you by ancient and catholic judgment.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-4"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h3>

<p>But let us take something far simpler than the Ninth Book of
"Paradise Lost" and more direct than any translated masterpiece
can be in its appeal; something of high genius, written in our
mother tongue. Let us take "The Tempest."</p>

<p>Of "The Tempest" we may say confidently:</p>

<p>(1) that it is a literary masterpiece: the last most perfect
'fruit of the noblest tree in our English Forest';</p>

<p>(2) that its story is quite simple; intelligible to a child: (its
basis in fact is fairy-tale, pure and simple—as I tried to show
in a previous lecture);</p>

<p>(3) that in reading it—or in reading "Hamlet," for that matter—
the child has no sense at all of being patronised, of being
'written down to.' And this has the strongest bearing on my
argument. The great authors, as Emerson says, never condescend.
Shakespeare himself speaks to a slip of a boy, and that boy feels
that he <i>is</i> Ferdinand;</p>

<p>(4) that, though Shakespeare uses his loftiest, most accomplished
and, in a sense, his most difficult language: a way of talking it
has cost him a life-time to acquire, in line upon line inviting
the scholar's, prosodist's, poet's most careful study; that
language is no bar to the child's enjoyment: but rather casts
about the whole play an aura of magnificence which, with the
assistant harmonies, doubles and redoubles the spell. A child no
more resents this because it is strange than he objects to read
in a fairytale of robbers concealed in oil-jars or of diamonds
big as a roc's egg. When will our educators see that what a child
depends on is imagination, that what he demands of life is the
wonderful, the glittering, possibility?</p>

<p>Now if, putting all this together and taking confidence from it,
we boldly launch a child upon "The Tempest" we shall come sooner
or later upon passages that <i>we</i> have arrived at finding
difficult. We shall come, for example, to the Masque of Iris,
which Iris, invoking Ceres, thus opens:</p>

<p>  Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas<br/>

  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;<br/>

  Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,<br/>

  And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep:<br/>

  Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims,<br/>

  Which spongy April at thy hest betrims—<br/>

  To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,<br/>

  Whose shadow the dismisséd bachelor loves,<br/>

  Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;<br/>

  And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard,<br/>

  Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o' th' sky,<br/>

  Whose watry arch and messenger am I,<br/>

  Bids thee leave these….<br/>
</p>

<p>The passage is undeniably hard for any child, even when you have
paused to explain who Ceres is, who Iris, who the Queen o' the
sky, and what Iris means by calling herself  'her watery arch and
messenger.' The grammatical structure not only stands on its head
but maintains that posture for an extravagant while. Naturally
(or rather let us say, ordinarily) it would run, 'Ceres, the
Queen o' the sky bids thee leave—thy rich leas, etc.' But, the
lines being twelve-and-a-half in number, we get no hint of there
being any grammatical subject until it bursts on us in the second
half of line eleven, while the two main verbs and the object of
one of them yet linger to be exploded in the last half-line,
'Bids thee leave these.' And this again is as nothing to the
difficulties of interpretation. 'Dismisséd bachelor' may be easy;
'pole-clipt vineyard' is certainly not, at first sight. 'To make
cold nymphs chaste crowns.' What cold nymphs? You have to wait
for another fifty odd lines before being quite sure that
Shakespeare means Naiads (and 'What are Naiads?' says the child)
—'temperate nymphs':</p>

<p>  You nymphs, called Naiads, of the windring brooks,<br/>

  With your sedged crowns…<br/>
</p>

<p>—and if the child demand what is meant by 'pionèd and twillèd
brims,' you have to answer him that nobody knows.</p>

<p>These difficulties—perhaps for you, certainly for the young
reader or listener—are reserved delights. My old schoolmaster
even indulges this suspicion—'I never can persuade myself that
Shakespeare would have passed high in a Civil Service Examination
on one of his own plays.' At any rate you don't <i>begin</i> with
these difficulties: you don't (or I hope you don't) read the
notes first: since, as Bacon puts it, 'Studies teach not their
own use.'</p>

<p>As for the child, he is not '<i>grubbing</i> for beauties'; he
magnificently ignores what he cannot for the moment understand,
being intent on <i>What Is,</i> the heart and secret of the adventure.
He <i>is</i> Ferdinand (I repeat) and the isle is 'full of voices.' If
these voices were all intelligible, why then, as Browning would
say, 'the less Island it.'</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-5"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h3>

<p>I have purposely exhibited "The Tempest" at its least tractable.
Who will deny that <i>as a whole</i> it can be made intelligible even
to very young children by the simple process of reading it with
them intelligently? or that the mysteries such a reading leaves
unexplained are of the sort to fascinate a child's mind and
allure it? But if this be granted, I have established my
contention that the Humanities should not be treated as a mere
crown and ornament of education; that they should inform every
part of it, from the beginning, in every school of the realm:
that whether a child have more education or less education, what
he has can be, and should be, a 'liberal education' throughout.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold, as every one knows, used to preach the use of
these masterpieces as prophylactics of taste. I would I could
make you feel that they are even more necessary to us.</p>

<p>The reason why?—The reason is that every child born in these
Islands is born into a democracy which, apart from home affairs,
stands committed to a high responsibility for the future welfare
and good governance of Europe. For three centuries or so it has
held rule over vast stretches of the earth's surface and many
millions of strange peoples: while its obligations towards the
general civilisation of Europe, if not intermittent, have been
tightened or relaxed, now here, now there, by policy, by
commerce, by dynastic alliances, by sudden revulsions or
sympathies. But this War will leave us bound to Europe as we
never have been: and, whether we like it or not, no less
inextricably bound to foe than to friend. Therefore, I say, it
has become important, and in a far higher degree than it ever was
before the War, that our countrymen grow up with a sense of what
I may call the <i>soul</i> of Europe. And nowhere but in literature
(which is `memorable speech')—or at any rate, nowhere so well as
in literature—can they find this sense.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-6"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VI</h3>

<p>There was, as we have seen, a time in Europe, extending over many
centuries, when mankind dwelt under the preoccupation of making
literature, and still making more of it. The 5th century B.C. in
Athens was such a time; and if you will you may envy, as we all
admire, the men of an age when to write at all was tantamount to
asserting genius; the men who, in Newman's words, `deserve to be
Classics, both because of what they do and because they can do
it.' If you envy—while you envy—at least remember that these
things often paid their price; that the "Phaedo," for example,
was bought for us by the death of Socrates. Pass Athens and come
to Alexandria: still men are accumulating books and the material
for books; threshing out the Classics into commentaries and
grammars, garnering books in great libraries.</p>

<p>There follows an age which interrupts this hive-like labour with
sudden and insensate destruction. German tribes from the north,
Turkish from the east, break in upon the granaries and send up
literature in flames; the Christian Fathers from Tertullian to
Gregory the Great (I regret to say) either heartily assisting or
at least warming their benedictory hands at the blaze: and so
thoroughly they do their work that even the writings of
Aristotle, the Philosopher, must wait for centuries as 'things
silently gone out of mind or things violently destroyed' (to
borrow Wordsworth's fine phrase) and creep back into Europe bit
by bit, under cover of Arabic translations.</p>

<p>The scholars set to work and begin rebuilding: patient,
indefatigable, anonymous as the coral insects at work on a
Pacific atoll-building, building, until on the near side of the
gulf we call the Dark Age, islets of scholarship lift themselves
above the waters: mere specks at first, but ridges appear and
connect them: and, to first seeming, sterile enough:</p>

<p>  Nec Cereri opportuna seges, nec commoda Baccho—</p>

<p>but as they join and become a <i>terra firma,</i> a thin soil gathers
on them God knows whence: and, God knows whence, the seed is
brought, 'it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain.' There
is a price, again, for this resurrection: but how nobly, how
blithely paid you may learn, without seeking recondite examples,
from Cuthbert's famous letter describing the death of Bede.
Compare that story with that of the last conversation of
Socrates; and you will surely recognise that the two men are
brothers born out of time; that Bede's work has been a legacy;
that his life has been given to recreating—not scholarship
merely nor literature merely—but, through them both, something
above them both—the soul of Europe. And this may or may not lead
you on to reflect that beyond our present passions, and beyond
this War, in a common sanity Europe (and America with her) will
have to discover that common soul again.</p>

<p>But eminent spirits such as Bede's are, by their very eminence,
less representative of the process—essentially fugitive and
self-abnegatory—than the thousands of copyists who have left no
name behind them. Let me read you a short paragraph from "The
Cambridge History of English Literature," Chapter 11, written,
the other day, by one of our own teachers:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The cloister was the centre of life in the monastery, and in
  the cloister was the workshop of the patient scribe. It is hard
  to realise that the fair and seemly handwriting of these
  manuscripts was executed by fingers which, on winter days,
  when the wind howled through the cloisters, must have been
  numbed by icy cold. It is true that, occasionally, little
  carrels or studies in the recesses of the windows were screened
  off from the main walk of the cloister, and, sometimes, a small
  room or cell would be partitioned off for the use of a single
  scribe. The room would then be called the Scriptorium, but it
  is unlikely that any save the oldest and most learned of the
  community were afforded this luxury. In these scriptoria of
  various kinds the earliest annals and chronicles in the
  English language were penned, in the beautiful and painstaking
  forms in which we know them.</p>

<p>If you seek testimony, here are the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of a poor
monk of Wessobrunn endorsed upon his MS:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The book which you now see was written in the outer seats
  of the cloister. While I wrote I froze: and what I could not
  write by the beams of day I finished by candlelight.</p>

<p>We might profitably spend—but to-day cannot spare—a while upon
the pains these men of the Middle Ages took to accumulate books
and to keep them. The chained volumes in old libraries, for
example, might give us a text for this as well as start us
speculating why it is that, to this day, the human conscience
incurably declines to include books with other portable property
covered by the Eighth Commandment. Or we might follow several of
the early scholars and humanists in their passionate chasings
across Europe, in and out of obscure monasteries, to recover the
lost MSS of the classics: might tell, for instance, of Pope
Nicholas V, whose birth-name was Tommaso Parentucelli, and how he
rescued the MSS from Constantinople and founded the Vatican
Library: or of Aurispa of Sicily who collected two hundred and
thirty-eight for Florence: or the story of the <i>editio princeps</i>
of the Greek text of Homer. Or we might dwell on the awaking of
our literature, and the trend given to it, by men of the Italian
and French renaissance; or on the residence of Erasmus here, in
this University, with its results.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-7"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VII</h3>

<p>But I have said enough to make it clear that, as we owe so much
of our best to understanding Europe, so the need to understand
Europe lies urgently to-day upon large classes in this country;
and that yet, in the nature of things, these classes can never
enjoy such leisure as our forefathers enjoyed to understand what
I call the soul of Europe, or at least to misunderstand it <i>upon
acquaintance.</i></p>

<p>Let me point out further that within the last few months we have
doubled the difficulty at a stroke by sharing the government of
our country with women and admitting them to Parliament. It
beseems a great nation to take great risks: to dare them is at
once a sign and a property of greatness: and for good or ill—but
for limitless good as we trust—our country has quietly made this
enterprise amid the preoccupations of the greatest War in its
annals. Look at it as you will—let other generations judge
it as they will—it stands a monument of our faith in free
self-government that in these most perilous days we gave and took
so high a guerdon of trust in one another.</p>

<p>But clearly it implies that all the women of this country, down
to the small girls entering our elementary schools, must be
taught a great many things their mothers and grandmothers—happy
in their generation—were content not to know[1].</p>

<p>It cannot be denied, I think, that in the long course of this
War, now happily on the point of a victorious conclusion, we have
suffered heavily through past neglect and present nescience of
our literature, which is so much more European, so much more
catholic, a thing than either our politics or our national
religion: that largely by reason of this neglect and this
nescience our statesmen have again and again failed to foresee
how continental nations would act through failing to understand
their minds; and have almost invariably, through this lack of
sympathetic understanding, failed to interpret us to foreign
friend or foe, even when (and it was not often) they interpreted
us to ourselves. I note that America—a country with no
comparable separate tradition of literature—has customarily
chosen men distinguished by the grace of letters for ambassadors
to the Court of St James—Motley, Lowell, Hay, Page, in our time:
and has for her President a man of letters—and a Professor at
that!—whereas, even in these critical days, Great Britain,
having a most noble cause and at least half-a-hundred writers and
speakers capable of presenting it with dignity and so clearly
that no neutral nation could mistake its logic, has by preference
entrusted it to stunt journalists and film-artistes. If in these
later days you have lacked a voice to interpret you in the great
accent of a Chatham, the cause lies in past indifference to that
literary tradition which is by no means the least among the
glories of our birth and state.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-8"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VIII</h3>

<p>Masterpieces, then, will serve us as prophylactics of taste, even
from childhood; and will help us, further, to interpret the
common mind of civilisation. But they have a third and yet nobler
use. They teach us to lift our own souls.</p>

<p>For witness to this and to the way of it I am going to call an
old writer for whom, be it whim or not, I have an almost 18th
century reverence—Longinus. No one exactly knows who he was;
although it is usual to identify him with that Longinus who
philosophised in the court of the Queen Zenobia and was by her,
in her downfall, handed over with her other counsellors to be
executed by Aurelian: though again, as is usual, certain bold bad
men affirm that, whether he was this Longinus or not, the
treatise of which I speak was not written by any Longinus at all
but by someone with a different name, with which they are
unacquainted. Be this as it may, somebody wrote the treatise and
its first editor, Francis Robertello of Basle, in 1554 called him
Dionysius Longinus; and so shall I, and have done with it,
careless that other MSS than that used by Robertello speak of
Dionysius or Longinus. Dionysius Longinus, then, in the 3rd
century A.D.—some say in the 1st: it is no great matter—wrote a
little book [Greek: PERI UPSOUS] commonly cited as "Longinus on
the Sublime." The title is handy, but quite misleading, unless
you remember that by 'Sublimity' Longinus meant, as he expressly
defines it, 'a certain distinction and excellence in speech.' The
book, thus recovered, had great authority with critics of the
17th and 18th centuries. For the last hundred years it has quite
undeservedly gone out of vogue.</p>

<p>It is (I admit) a puzzling book, though quite clear in argument
and language: pellucidly clear, but here and there strangely
modern, even hauntingly modern, if the phrase may be allowed. You
find yourself rubbing your eyes over a passage more like Matthew
Arnold than something of the 3rd century: or you come without
warning on a few lines of 'comparative criticism,' as we call it
—an illustration from Genesis—'God said, Let there be Light,
and there was Light' used for a specimen of the exalted way of
saying things. Generally, you have a sense that this author's
lineage is mysterious after the fashion of Melchisedek's.</p>

<p>Well, to our point—Longinus finds that the conditions of lofty
utterance are five: of which the first is by far the most
important. And this foremost condition is innate: you either have
it or you have not. Here it is:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  'Elsewhere,' says Longinus, 'I have written as follows:
  <i>"Sublimity is the echo of a great soul."</i> Hence even a bare
  idea sometimes, by itself and without a spoken word will
  excite admiration, just because of the greatness of soul
  implied. Thus the silence of Ajax in the underworld is great
  and more sublime than words.'</p>

<p>You remember the passage, how Odysseus meets that great spirit
among the shades and would placate it, would 'make up' their
quarrel on earth now, with carneying words:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  'Ajax, son of noble Telamon, wilt thou not then, even in
  death forget thine anger against me over that cursed
  armour…. Nay, there is none other to blame but Zeus: he
  laid thy doom on thee. Nay, come hither, O my lord, and
  hear me and master thine indignation:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  So I spake, but he answered me not a word, but strode from
  me into the Darkness, following the others of the dead that
  be departed.</p>

<p>Longinus goes on:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  It is by all means necessary to point this out—that the truly
  eloquent must be free from base and ignoble (or ill-bred)
  thoughts. For it is not possible that men who live their lives
  with mean and servile aims and ideas should produce what is
  admirable and worthy of immortality. Great accents we expect to
  fall from the lips of those whose thoughts are dignified.</p>

<p>Believe this and it surely follows, as concave implies convex,
that by daily converse and association with these great ones we
take their breeding, their manners, earn their magnanimity, make
ours their gifts of courtesy, unselfishness, mansuetude, high
seated pride, scorn of pettiness, wholesome plentiful jovial
laughter.</p>

<p>  He that of such a height hath built his mind,<br/>

  And rear'd the dwelling of his soul so strong<br/>

  As neither fear nor hope can shake the frame<br/>

  Of his resolvèd powers, nor all the wind<br/>

  Of vanity or malice pierce to wrong<br/>

  His settled peace, or to disturb the same;<br/>

     What a fair seat hath he, from whence he may<br/>

     The boundless wastes and wilds of man survey!<br/>
</p>

<p>  And with how free an eye doth he look down<br/>

  Upon these lower regions of turmoil!<br/>

  Where all the storms of passions mainly beat<br/>

  On flesh and blood; where honour, power, renown,<br/>

  Are only gay afflictions, golden toil;<br/>

  Where greatness stands upon as feeble feet<br/>

     As frailty doth; and only great doth seem<br/>

     To little minds, who do it so esteem….<br/>
</p>

<p>  Knowing the heart of man is set to be<br/>

  The centre of this world, about the which<br/>

  These revolutions of disturbances<br/>

  Still roll; where all th' aspects of misery<br/>

  Predominate; whose strong effects are such<br/>

  As he must bear, being powerless to redress;<br/>

     And that, unless above himself he can<br/>

     Erect himself, how poor a thing is man![2]<br/>
</p>

</section><section id="chapter-12-9"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IX</h3>

<p>If the exhortation of these verses be somewhat too high and
stoical for you, let me return to Longinus and read you, from his
concluding chapter, a passage you may find not inapposite to
these times, nor without a moral:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  'It remains' [he says] 'to clear up, my dear Terentianus, a
  question which a certain philosopher has recently mooted. I
  wonder,' he says, 'as no doubt do many others, how it happens
  that in our time there are men who have the gift of persuasion
  to the utmost extent, and are well fitted for public life, and
  are keen and ready, and particularly rich in all the charms of
  language, yet there no longer arise really lofty and
  transcendent natures unless it be quite peradventure. So great
  and world-wide a dearth of high utterance attends our age.
  Can it be,' he continued, 'we are to accept the common cant
  that democracy is the nursing mother of genius, and that great
  men of letters flourish and die with it? For freedom, they say,
  has the power to cherish and encourage magnanimous minds, and
  with it is disseminated eager mutual rivalry and the emulous
  thirst to excel. Moreover, by the prizes open under a popular
  government, the mental faculties of orators are perpetually
  practised and whetted, and as it were, rubbed bright, so that
  they shine free as the state itself. Whereas to-day,' he went
  on, 'we seem to have learnt as an infant-lesson that servitude
  is the law of life; being all wrapped, while our thoughts are
  yet young and tender, in observances and customs as in
  swaddling clothes, bound without access to that fairest and
  most fertile source of man's speech (I mean Freedom) so that we
  are turned out in no other guise than that of servile
  flatterers. And servitude (it has been well said) though
  it be even righteous, is the cage of the soul and a public
  prison-house.'</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But I answered him thus.—'It is easy, my good sir, and
  characteristic of human nature, to gird at the age in which
  one lives. Yet consider whether it may not be true that it is
  less the world's peace that ruins noble nature than this war
  illimitable which holds our aspirations in its fist, and
  occupies our age with passions as with troops that utterly
  plunder and harry it. The love of money and the love of
  pleasure enslave us, or rather, as one may say, drown us
  body and soul in their depths. For vast and unchecked
  wealth marches with lust of pleasure for comrade, and when
  one opens the gate of house or city, the other at once enters
  and abides. And in time these two build nests in the hearts
  of men, and quickly rear a progeny only too legitimate: and
  the ruin within the man is gradually consummated as the
  sublimities of his soul wither away and fade, and in ecstatic
  contemplation of our mortal parts we omit to exalt, and
  come to neglect in nonchalance, that within us which is
  immortal.'</p>

<p>I had a friend once who, being in doubt with what picture to
decorate the chimney-piece in his library, cast away choice and
wrote up two Greek words—[Greek: PSYCHES 'IATREION]; that is,
the hospital—the healing-place—of the soul.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">[Footnote 1: 'Well! … my education is at last finished: indeed
it would be strange, if, after five years' hard application,
anything were left incomplete. Happily that is all over now; and
I have nothing to do, but to exercise my various accomplishments.</p>

<p>'Let me see!—as to French, I am mistress of that, and speak it,
if possible, with more fluency than English. Italian I can read
with ease, and pronounce very well: as well at least, and better,
than any of my friends; and that is all one need wish for in
Italian. Music I have learned till I am perfectly sick of it. But
… it will be delightful to play when we have company. I must
still continue to practise a little;—the only thing, I think,
that I need now to improve myself in. And then there are my
Italian songs! which everybody allows I sing with taste, and as
it is what so few people can pretend to, I am particularly glad
that I can.</p>

<p>'My drawings are universally admired; especially the shells and
flowers; which are beautiful, certainly; besides this, I have a
decided taste in all kinds of fancy ornaments.</p>

<p>'And then my dancing and waltzing! in which our master himself
owned that he could take me no further! just the figure for it
certainly; it would be unpardonable if I did not excel.</p>

<p>'As to common things, geography, and history, and poetry, and
philosophy, thank my stars, I have got through them all! so that
I may consider myself not only perfectly accomplished, but also
thoroughly well-informed.</p>

<p>'Well, to be sure, how much have I fagged through—; the only
wonder is that one head can contain it all.'</p>

<p>I found this in a little book "Thoughts of Divines and
Philosophers," selected by Basil Montagu. The quotation is
signed 'J. T.' I cannot trace it, but suspect Jane Taylor.]</p>
