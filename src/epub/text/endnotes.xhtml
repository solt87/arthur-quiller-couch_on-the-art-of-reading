					<p>The reader will kindly turn back to <a href="chapter-1.xhtml">the start of the chapter</a>, and observe the date at the head of this lecture. At that time I was engaged against a system of English teaching which I believed to be thoroughly bad. That system has since given place to another, which I am prepared to defend as a better. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Do you remember, by the by, Samuel Rogers’s lines on Lady Jane Grey? They have always seemed to me very beautiful:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>Like her most gentle, most unfortunate,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Crown’d but to die⁠—who in her chamber sate</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Musing with Plato, though the horn was blown,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And every ear and every heart was won,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And all in green array were chasing down the sun!</span>

					<p>Why had he to swear this under pain of excommunication, when the lecturer could so easily keep a roll-call? But the amount of oathtaking in a medieval University was prodigious. Even College servants were put on oath for their duties: Gyps invited their own damnation, bed-makers kissed the book. Abroad, where examinations were held, the Examiner swore not to take a bribe, the Candidate neither to give one, nor, if unsuccessful, to take his vengeance on the Examiner with a knife or other sharp instrument. At New College, Oxford, the matriculating undergraduate was required to swear in particular not to dance in the College Chapel. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The loose and tautologous style of this Preface is worth noting. Likely enough Browne wrote it in a passion that deprived him of his habitual self-command. One phrase alone reveals the true Browne⁠—that is, Browne true to himself: “and time that brings other things to light, should have satisfied me in the remedy of its oblivion. <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>Well!⁠ ⁠… my education is at last finished: indeed it would be strange, if, after five years’ hard application, anything were left incomplete. Happily that is all over now; and I have nothing to do, but to exercise my various accomplishments.</p>
						<p>Let me see!⁠—as to French, I am mistress of that, and speak it, if possible, with more fluency than English. Italian I can read with ease, and pronounce very well: as well at least, and better, than any of my friends; and that is all one need wish for in Italian. Music I have learned till I am perfectly sick of it. But⁠ ⁠… it will be delightful to play when we have company. I must still continue to practise a little;⁠—the only thing, I think, that I need now to improve myself in. And then there are my Italian songs! which everybody allows I sing with taste, and as it is what so few people can pretend to, I am particularly glad that I can.</p>
						<p>My drawings are universally admired; especially the shells and flowers; which are beautiful, certainly; besides this, I have a decided taste in all kinds of fancy ornaments.</p>
						<p>And then my dancing and waltzing! in which our master himself owned that he could take me no further! just the figure for it certainly; it would be unpardonable if I did not excel.</p>
						<p>As to common things, geography, and history, and poetry, and philosophy, thank my stars, I have got through them all! so that I may consider myself not only perfectly accomplished, but also thoroughly well-informed.</p>
						<p>Well, to be sure, how much have I fagged through⁠—; the only wonder is that one head can contain it all.</p>
