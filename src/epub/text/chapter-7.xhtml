<p>I have promised you, Gentlemen, for to-day some observations on
<i>The Value of Greek and Latin in English Literature</i>: a mild,
academic title, a <i>camouflage</i> title, so to say; calculated to
shelter us for a while from the vigilance of those hot-eyed
reformers who, had I advertised <i>The Value of Greek and Latin in
English Life</i> might even now be swooping from all quarters of the
sky on a suggestion that these dry bones yet were flesh: for
the eyes I dread are not only red and angry, but naturally
microscopic—and that indeed, if they only knew it, is their
malady. Yet 'surely' groaned patient job, 'there <i>is</i> a path
which the vulture's eye hath not seen!'</p>

<p>You, at any rate, know by this time that wherever these
lectures assert literature they assert life, perhaps even too
passionately, allowing neither the fact of death nor the
possibility of divorce.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-7-2"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>

<p>But let us begin with the first word, '<i>Value</i>'—'The <i>Value</i> of
Greek and Latin in English Literature.' What do I mean by
'Value'? Well, I use it, generally, in the sense of 'worth'; but
with a particular meaning, or shade of meaning, too. And, this
particular meaning is not the particular meaning intended (as I
suppose) by men of commerce who, on news of a friend's death,
fall a-musing and continue musing until the fire kindles, and
they ask 'What did So-and-so die worth?' or sometimes, more
wisely than they know, 'What did poor old So-and-so die worth?'
or again, more colloquially, 'What did So-and-so "cut up" for?'
Neither is it that which more disinterested economists used to
teach; men never (I fear me) loved, but anyhow lost awhile, who
for my green unknowing youth, at Thebes or Athens—growing older
I tend to forget which is, or was, which—defined the Value of a
thing as its 'purchasing power' which the market translates into
'price.' For—to borrow a phrase which I happened on, the other
day, with delight, in the Introduction to a translation of
Lucian—there may be forms of education less paying than the
commercial and yet better worth paying for; nay, above payment or
computation in price[1].</p>

<p>No: the particular meaning I use to-day is that which artists use
when they talk of painting or of music. To see things, near or
far, in their true perspective and proportions; to judge them
through distance; and fetching them back, to reproduce them in
art so proportioned comparatively, so rightly adjusted, that they
combine to make a particular and just perspective: that is to
give things their true <i>Values.</i></p>

<p>Suppose yourself reclining on a bank on a clear day, looking up
into the sky and watching the ascent of a skylark while you
listen to his song. That is a posture in which several poets of
repute have placed themselves from time to time: so we need not
be ashamed of it. Well, you see the atmosphere reaching up and
up, mile upon mile. There are no milestones planted there. But,
wave on wave perceptible, the atmosphere stretches up through
indeterminate distances; and according as your painter of the sky
can translate these distances, he gives his sky what is called
<i>Value.</i></p>

<p>You listen to the skylark's note rising, spiral by spiral, on
'the very jet of earth':</p>

<p>  As up he wings the spiral stair,<br/>

     A song of light, and pierces air<br/>

  With fountain ardour, fountain play,<br/>

     To reach the shining tops of day:<br/>
</p>

<p>and you long for the musical gift to follow up and up the
delicate degrees of distance and thread the notes back as the
bird ascending drops them—on a thread, as it were, of graduated
beads, half music and half dew:</p>

<p>     That was the chirp of Ariel<br/>

     You heard, as overhead it flew,<br/>

     The farther going more to dwell<br/>

     And wing our green to wed our blue;<br/>

     But whether note of joy, or knell,<br/>

     Not his own Father-singer knew;<br/>

     Nor yet can any mortal tell,<br/>

     Save only how it shivers through;<br/>

     The breast of us a sounded shell,<br/>

     The blood of us a lighted dew.<br/>
</p>

<p>Well in music, in painting, this graduating which gives right
proportion and, with proportion, a sense of distance, of
atmosphere, is called <i>Value.</i> Let us, for a minute or two, assay
this particular meaning of Value upon life and literature, and
first upon life, or, rather upon one not negligible facet of
life.</p>

<p>I suppose that if an ordinary man of my age were asked which has
better helped him to bear the burs of life—religion or a sense
of humour—he would, were he quite honest, be gravelled for an
answer. Now the best part of a sense of humour, as you know
without my telling you, consists in a sense of proportion; a
habit, abiding and prompt at command, of seeing all human,
affairs in their just perspective, so that its happy possessor at
once perceives anything odd or distorted or overblown to be an
excrescence, a protuberance, a swelling, literally a <i>humour</i>:
and the function of Thalia, the Comic Spirit, as you may read in
Meredith's "Essay on Comedy," is just to prick these humours. I
will but refer you to Meredith's "Essay," and here cite you the
words of an old schoolmaster:</p>

<p>It would seem to be characteristic of the same mind to appreciate
the beauty of ideas in just proportion and harmonious relation to
each other, and the absurdity of the same ideas when distorted or
brought into incongruous juxtaposition. The exercise of this
sense of humour … compels the mind to form a picture to itself,
accompanied by pleasurable emotion; and what is this but setting
the imagination to work, though in topsy-turvy fashion? Nay, in
such a case, imagination plays a double part, since it is only by
instantaneous comparison with ideal fitness and proportion
that it can grasp at full force the grotesqueness of their
contraries[2].</p>

<p>Let us play with an example for one moment. A child sees such an
excrescence, such an offence upon proportion, in an immoderately
long nose. He is apt to call attention to it on the visage of a
visitor: it intrigues him in Perrault's 'Prince Charming' and
many a fairy tale: it amuses him in Lear's "Book of Nonsense":</p>

<p>     There was an old man with a Nose,<br/>

     Who said 'If you choose to suppose<br/>

     That my nose is too long<br/>

     You are certainly wrong'—<br/>
</p>

<p>This old man he detects as lacking sense of proportion, sense of
humour. Pass from the child to the working-man as we know him. A
few weeks ago, a lady—featured, as to nose, on the side of
excess—was addressing a North Country audience on the Economic
Position of Women after the War. Said she, 'There won't be men to
go round.' Said a voice 'Eh, but they'll <i>have to,</i> Miss!' Pass
from this rudimentary criticism to high talent employed on the
same subject, and you get "Cyrano de Bergerac." Pass to genius,
to Milton, and you find the elephant amusing Adam and Eve in
Paradise, and doing his best:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6%; margin-right: 6%">     the unwieldy elephant,
  To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed
  His lithe proboscis.</p>

<p>Milton, like the elephant, jokes with difficulty, but he, too, is
using all his might.</p>

<p>I have illustrated, crudely enough, how a sense of things in
their right values will help us on one side of our dealings with
life. But truly it helps us on every side. This was what Plato
meant when he said that a philosopher must see things as they
relatively are within his horizon—[Greek: o synoptikos
dialektikos]. And for this it was that an English poet praised
Sophocles as one</p>

<p>     Who saw life steadily, and saw it whole.</p>

<p>And this of course is what Dean Inge meant when, the other day,
in a volume of "Cambridge Essays on Education," he reminded us,
for a sensible commonplace, that 'The wise man is he who knows
the relative values of things.'</p>

</section><section id="chapter-7-3"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h3>

<p>Applying this to literature, I note, but shall not insist here on
the fact—though fact it is—that the Greek and Roman 'classical'
writers (as we call them) laid more stress than has ever been
laid among the subsequent tribes of men upon the desirability of
getting all things into proportion, of seeing all life on a scale
of relative values. And the reason I shall not insist on this is
simply that better men have saved me the trouble.</p>

<p>I propose this morning to discuss the value of the classics to
students of English literature from, as the modern phrase goes, a
slightly different angle.</p>

<p>Reclining and looking up into that sky which is not too grandiose
an image for our own English Literature, you would certainly not
wish, Gentlemen, to see it as what it is not—as a cloth painted
on the flat. No more than you would choose the sky overarching
your life to be a close, hard, copper vault, would you choose
this literature of ours to resemble such a prison. I say nothing,
for the moment, of the thrill of comparing ours with other
constellations—of such a thrill as Blanco White's famous sonnet
imagines in Adam's soul when the first night descended on Eden
and</p>

<p>  Hesperus with the host of heaven came,<br/>

  And lo! Creation widen'd in man's view.<br/>

  Who could have thought such darkness lay conceal'd<br/>

  Within thy beams, O sun!…<br/>
</p>

<p>No: I simply picture you as desiring to realise <i>our own</i>
literature, its depths and values, mile above mile deeper and
deeper shining, with perchance a glimpse of a city celestial
beyond, or at whiles, on a ladder of values, of the angels—the
messengers—climbing and returning.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-7-4"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h3>

<p>Well, now, I put it to you that without mental breeding, without
at least some sense of ancestry, an Englishman can hardly have
this perception of value, this vision. I put to you what I
posited in an earlier course of lectures, quoting Bagehot, that
while a knowledge of Greek and Latin is not necessary to a writer
of English, he should at least have a firm conviction that those
two languages existed. I refer you to a long passage which, in
one of those lectures, I quoted from Cardinal Newman to the
effect that for the last 3000 years the Western World has
been evolving a human society, having its bond <i>in a common
civilisation</i>—a society to which (let me add, by way of
footnote) Prussia today is firmly, though with great difficulty,
being tamed. There are, and have been, other civilisations in the
world —the Chinese, for instance; a huge civilisation,
stationary, morose, to us unattractive; 'but <i>this</i>
civilisation,' says Newman, 'together with the society which is
its creation and its home, is so distinctive and luminous in its
character, so imperial in its extent, so imposing in its
duration, and so utterly without rival upon the face of the
earth, that the association may fitly assume for itself the title
of "Human Society," and its civilisation the abstract term
"Civilisation".'</p>

<p>He goes on:</p>

<p>  Looking, then, at the countries which surround the<br/>

  Mediterranean Sea as a whole, I see them to be, from time<br/>

  immemorial, the seat of an association of intellect and mind<br/>

  such as deserves to be called the Intellect and Mind of the<br/>

  Human Kind.<br/>
</p>

<p>But I must refer you to his famous book "The Idea of a<br/>

University" to read at length how Newman, in that sinuous,<br/>

sinewy, Platonic style of his, works it out—the spread, through<br/>

Rome, even to our shores, of the civilisation which began in<br/>

Palestine and Greece.<br/>
</p>

</section><section id="chapter-7-5"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VI</h3>

<p>I would press the point more rudely upon you, and more
particularly, than does Newman. And first, for Latin—</p>

<p>I waive that Rome occupied and dominated this island during 400
years. Let that be as though it had never been. For a further
1000 years and more Latin remained the common speech of educated
men throughout Europe: the 'Universal Language.' Greek had been
smothered by the Turk. Through all that time—through the most of
what we call Modern History, Latin reigned everywhere. Is this a
fact to be ignored by any of you who would value 'values'?</p>

<p>Here are a few particulars, by way of illustration. More wrote
his "Utopia," Bacon wrote all the bulk of his philosophical work,
in Latin; Newton wrote his "Principia" in Latin. Keble's Lectures
on Poetry (if their worth and the name of Keble may together save
me from bathos) were delivered in Latin. Our Vice-Chancellor, our
Public Orator still talk Latin, securing for it what attention
they can: nor have</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6%; margin-right: 6%">     The bigots of this iron time
     <i>Yet</i> call'd their harmless art a crime.</p>

<p>But there is a better reason why you should endeavour to
understand the value of Latin in our literature; a filial reason.
Our fathers built their great English prose, as they built their
oratory, upon the Latin model. Donne used it to construct his
mighty fugues: Burke to discipline his luxuriance. Says Cowper,
it were</p>

<p>     Praise enough for any private man,<br/>

     That Chatham's language was his mother tongue,<br/>

     And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own.<br/>
</p>

<p>Well then, here is a specimen of Chatham's language: from his
speech, Romanly severe, denouncing the Government of the day for
employing Red Indians in the American War of Independence. He is
addressing the House of Lords:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I call upon that right reverend bench, those holy ministers
  of the Gospel, and pious pastors of our Church—I conjure
  them to join in the holy work, and vindicate the religion of
  their God. I appeal to the wisdom and the law of this learned
  bench to defend and support the justice of their country. I
  call upon the bishops to interpose the unsullied sanctity of
  their lawn; upon the learned judges to interpose the purity of
  their ermine, to save us from this pollution. I call upon the
  honour of your lordships to reverence the dignity of your
  ancestors, and to maintain your own. I call upon the spirit
  and humanity of my country to vindicate the national
  character. I invoke the genius of the Constitution. From the
  tapestry that adorns these walls the immortal ancestor of this
  noble lord [Lord Suffolk] frowns with indignation at the
  disgrace of his country. In vain he led your victorious fleet:
  against the boasted Armada of Spain; in vain he defended
  and established the honour, the liberties, the religion—the
  <i>Protestant religion</i>—of this country, against the arbitrary
  cruelties of Popery and the Inquisition, if these more than
  Popish cruelties and inquisitorial practices are let loose
  among us—to turn forth into our settlements, among our
  ancient connexions, friends, and relations, the merciless
  cannibal, thirsting for the blood of man, woman, and child!
  to send forth the infidel savage—-against whom? against your
  Protestant brethren; to lay waste their country, to desolate
  their dwellings, and extirpate their race and name, with these
  horrible hell-hounds of savage war!—hell-hounds, I say, of
  savage war! Spain armed herself with blood-hounds to extirpate
  the wretched natives of America, and we improve on the inhuman
  example even of Spanish cruelty; we turn loose these savage
  hell-hounds against our brethren and countrymen in America, of
  the same language, laws, liberties, and religion, endeared to
  us by every tie that should sanctify humanity….</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  My lords, I am old and weak, and at present unable to say more;
  but my feelings and indignation were too strong to have said
  less. I could not have slept this night in my bed, nor reposed
  my head on my pillow, without giving this vent to my eternal
  abhorrence of such preposterous and enormous principles.</p>

<p>That was Chatham. For Wolfe—he, as you know, was ever reading
the classics even on campaign: as Burke again carried always a
Virgil in his pocket. <i>Abeunt studia in mores.</i> Moreover can we
separate Chatham's Roman morality from Chatham's language in the
passage I have just read? No: we cannot. No one, being evil, can
speak good things with that weight; <i>'for out of the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh.'</i> We English (says Wordsworth)</p>

<p>     We must be free or die, who speak the tongue<br/>

     That Shakespeare spake….<br/>
</p>

<p>You may criticise Chatham's style as too consciously Ciceronian.
But has ever a Parliamentary style been invented which conveys a
nobler gravity of emotion? `Buskined'?—yes: but the style of a
man. 'Mannered'?—yes, but in the grand manner. 'Conscious'?—
yes, but of what? Conscious of the dignity a great man owes to
himself, and to the assembly he addresses. He conceives that
assembly as 'the British Senate'; and, assuming, he communicates
that high conception. The Lords feel that they are listening as
Senators, since it is only thus a Senate should be addressed, as
nothing less than a Senate should be addressed thus.</p>

<p>Let me read you a second passage; of <i>written</i> prose:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Laodameia died; Helen died; Leda, the beloved of Jupiter,
  went before. It is better to repose in the earth betimes than
  to sit up late; better, than to cling pertinaciously to what
  we feel crumbling under us, and to protract an inevitable
  fall. We may enjoy the present while we are insensible of
  infirmity and decay: but the present, like a note in music,
  is nothing but as it appertains to what is past and what is
  to come. There are no fields of amaranth on this aide of the
  grave; there are no voices, O Rhodopè! that are not soon mute,
  however tuneful; there is no name, with whatever emphasis of
  passionate love repeated, of which the echo is not faint at
  last[3].</p>

<p>Latin—all Latin—down to its exquisite falling close! And I say
to you, Gentlemen, that passages such as these deserve what
Joubert claimed of national monuments, <i>Ce sont les crampons qui
unissent une génération à une autre. Conservez ce qu'ont vu vos
pères,</i> 'These are the clamps that knit one generation to
another. Cherish those things on which your fathers' eyes have
looked.'</p>

<p><i>Abeunt studia in mores.</i></p>

<p>If, years ago, there had lacked anything to sharpen my suspicion
of those fork-bearded professors who derived our prose from the
stucco of Anglo-Saxon prose, it would have been their foolish
deliberate practice of composing whole pages of English prose
without using one word derivative from Latin or Greek. Esau, when
he sold his birthright, had the excuse of being famished. These
pedants, with a full board, sought frenetically to give it away—
board and birthright. <i>'So when this corruptible shall have put
on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality'</i>
—almost, I say, these men had deserved to have a kind of speech
more to their taste read over their coffins.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-7-6"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VII</h3>

<p>What, in the next place, can I say of Greek, save that, as Latin
gave our fathers the model of prose, Greek was the source of it
all, the goddess and genius of the well-head? And, casting about
to illustrate, as well as may be, what I mean by this, I hit on a
minor dialogue of Plato, the "Phaedrus," and choose you a short
passage in Edward FitzGerald's rendering:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  When Socrates and Phaedrus have discoursed away the noon-day
  under the plane trees by the Ilissus, they rise to depart
  toward the city. But Socrates (pointing perhaps to some images
  of Pan and other sylvan deities) says it is not decent to leave
  their haunts without praying to them, and he prays:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  'O auspicious Pan, and ye other deities of this place, grant to
  me to become beautiful <i>inwardly,</i> and that all my outward
  goods may prosper my inner soul. Grant that I may esteem wisdom
  the only riches, and that I may have so much gold as temperance
  can handsomely carry.</p>

<p>  'Have we yet aught else to pray for, Phaedrus? For myself I<br/>

  seem to have prayed enough.'<br/>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  <i>Phaedrus</i>: 'Pray as much for me also: for friends have all
  in common.'</p>

<p>  <i>Socrates</i>: 'Even so be it. Let us depart'</p>

<p>To this paternoster of Socrates, reported more than four
centuries before Christ taught the Lord's Prayer, let me add an
attempted translation of the lines that close Homer's hymn to the
Delian Apollo. Imagine the old blind poet on the beach chanting
to the islanders the glorious boast of the little island—how it
of all lands had harboured Leto in her difficult travail; how she
gave birth to the Sun God; how the immortal child, as the
attendant goddesses touched his lips with ambrosia, burst his
swaddling bands and stood up, sudden, a god erect:</p>

<p>  But he, the Sun-God, did no sooner taste<br/>

  That food divine than every swaddling band<br/>

     Burst strand by strand,<br/>

  And burst the belt above his panting waist—<br/>

     All hanging loose<br/>

  About him as he stood and gave command:<br/>

  'Fetch me my lyre, fetch me my curving bow!<br/>

  And, taught by these, shall know<br/>

  All men, through me, the unfaltering will of Zeus!'<br/>

  So spake the unshorn God, the Archer bold,<br/>

  And turn'd to tread the ways of Earth so wide;<br/>

  While they, all they, had marvel to behold<br/>

     How Delos broke in gold<br/>

  Beneath his feet, as on a mountain-side<br/>

  Sudden, in Spring, a tree is glorified<br/>

  And canopied with blossoms manifold.<br/>

  But he went swinging with a careless stride,<br/>

  Proud, in his new artillery bedight,<br/>

  Up rocky Cynthus, and the isles descried—<br/>

  All his, and their inhabitants—for wide,<br/>

  Wide as he roam'd, ran these in rivalry<br/>

  To build him temples in many groves:<br/>

  And these be his, and all the isles he loves,<br/>

     And every foreland height,<br/>

  And every river hurrying to the sea.<br/>

     But chief in thee,<br/>

  Delos, as first it was, is his delight.<br/>

  Where the long-robed Ionians, each with mate<br/>

  And children, pious to his altar throng,<br/>

     And, decent, celebrate<br/>

  His birth with boxing-match and dance and song:<br/>

  So that a stranger, happening them among,<br/>

  Would deem that these Ionians have no date,<br/>

  Being ageless, all so met;<br/>

     And he should gaze<br/>

     And marvel at their ways,<br/>

  Health, wealth, the comely face<br/>

  On man and woman—envying their estate—<br/>

     And yet<br/>

  <i>You</i> shall he least be able to forget,<br/>

  You maids of Delos, dear ones, as ye raise<br/>

  The hymn to Phoebus, Leto, Artemis,<br/>

     In triune praise,<br/>

  Then slide your song back upon ancient days<br/>

  And men whose very name forgotten is.,<br/>

  And women who have lived and gone their ways:<br/>

  And make them live agen,<br/>

  Charming the tribes of men,<br/>

  Whose speech ye mock with pretty mimicries<br/>

     So true<br/>

     They almost woo<br/>

  The hearer to believe he's singing too!<br/>

  Speed me, Apollo: speed me, Artemis!<br/>

  And you, my dears, farewell! Remember me<br/>

  Hereafter if, from any land that is,<br/>

  Some traveller question ye—<br/>

  'Maidens, who was the sweetest man of speech<br/>

  Fared hither, ever chanted on this beach?'<br/>

     I you beseech<br/>

  Make answer to him, civilly—<br/>

  'Sir, he was just a blind man, and his home<br/>

  In rocky Chios. But his songs were best,<br/>

  And shall be ever in the days to come.'<br/>

  Say that: and as I quest<br/>

  In fair wall'd cities far, I'll tell them there<br/>

     (They'll list, for 'twill be true)<br/>

     Of Delos and of you.<br/>

  But chief and evermore my song shall be<br/>

  Of Prince Apollo, lord of Archery.<br/>

  God of the Silver Bow, whom Leto bare—<br/>

     Leto, the lovely-tress'd.<br/>
</p>

<p>Did time permit, I might quote you a chorus of Aeschylus, a
passage from Thucydides or from Aristotle, to illustrate Gibbon's
saying that the Greek language 'gave a soul to the objects of
sense, and a body to the abstractions of metaphysics.' But there
it is, and it has haunted our literature; at first filtering
through Latin, at length breaking from Constantinople in flood
and led to us, to Oxford and Cambridge, by Erasmus, by Grocyn:</p>

<p>     Thee, that lord of splendid lore<br/>

     Orient from old Hellas' shore.<br/>
</p>

<p>To have a sense of Greek, too, is to own a corrective of taste. I
quote another old schoolmaster here—a dead friend, Sidney Irwin:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  What the Greeks disliked was extravagance, caprice,
  boastfulness, and display of all kinds…. The Greeks <i>hated</i> all
  monsters. The quaint phrase in the "Odyssey" about the Queen
  of the Laestrygones—'She was tall as a mountain, and they
  hated her'—would have seemed to them most reasonable….
  To read Greek is to have a perpetual witness to the virtue
  of pruning—of condensing—a perpetual protest against all
  that crowds, and swells, and weakens the writer's purpose.
  To forget this is but to 'confound our skill in covetousness.'
  We cannot all be writers … but we all wish to have good
  taste, and good taste is born of a generous caution about
  letting oneself go. I say <i>generous,</i> for caution is seldom
  generous—but it is a generous mood which is in no haste to
  assert itself. To consider the thing, the time, the place, the
  person, and to take yourself and your own feelings <i>only fifth</i>
  is to be armour-proof against bad taste.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-7-7"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VIII</h3>

<p>They tell us that Greek is going, here. Well, I hold no brief for
compulsory Greek; and I shall say but one word on it. I put it,
rather idly, to a vote in a Cambridge Combination Room, the other
day, and was amazed to find how the votes were divided. The men
of science were by no means unanimous. They owned that there was
much to be said even for compulsory Greek, if only Greek had been
intelligently taught. And with that, of course, I agree: for to
learn Greek is, after all, a baptism into a noble cult. The
Romans knew <i>that.</i> I believe that, even yet, if the schools
would rebuild their instruction in Greek so as to make it
interesting, as it ought to be, from the first, we should oust
those birds who croak and chatter upon the walls of our old
Universities. I find the following in FitzGerald's "Polonius":</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  An old ruinous tower which had harboured innumerable
  jackdaws, sparrows, and bats, was at length repaired. When
  the masons left it, the jackdaws, sparrows, and bats came back
  in search of their old dwellings. But these were all filled up.
  'Of what use now is this great building?' said they, 'come let
  us forsake this useless stone-heap:</p>

<p>And the beauty of this little apologue is that you can read it
either way.</p>

<p>But, although a student of English Literature be ignorant of
Greek and Latin as languages, may he not have Greek and Latin
literature widely opened to him by intelligent translations? The
question has often been asked, but I ask it again. May not <i>some</i>
translations open a door to him by which he can see them through
an atmosphere, and in that atmosphere the authentic ancient gods
walking: so that returning upon English literature he may
recognise them there, too, walking and talking in a garden of
values? The highest poetical speech of any one language defies,
in my belief, translation into any other. But Herodotus loses
little, and North is every whit as good as Plutarch.</p>

<p>  Sigh no more, ladies; ladies, sigh no more!<br/>

     Men were deceivers ever;<br/>

  One foot in sea and one on shore,<br/>

     To one thing constant never<br/>
</p>

<p>Suppose that rendered thus:</p>

<p>I enjoin upon the adult female population ([Greek: gynaikes]),
not once but twice, that there be from this time forward, a total
cessation of sighing. The male is, and has been, constantly
addicted to inconstancy, treading the ocean and the mainland
respectively with alternate feet.</p>

<p>That, more or less, is what Paley did upon Euripides, and how
would you like it if a modern Greek did it upon Shakespeare? None
the less I remember that my own first awed surmise of what Greek
might mean came from a translated story of Herodotus—the story
of Cleobis and Biton—at the tail of an old grammar-book, before
I had learnt the Greek alphabet; and I am sure that the instinct
of the old translators was sound; that somehow (as Wordsworth
says somewhere) the present must be balanced on the wings of the
past and the future, and that as you stretch out the one you
stretch out the other to strength.</p>

<p>There is no derogation of new things in this plea I make
specially to you who may be candidates in our School of English.
You may remember my reading to you in a previous lecture that
liberal poem of Cory's invoking the spirit of 'dear divine
Comatas,' that</p>

<p>  Two minds shall flow together, the English and the Greek.</p>

<p>Well, I would have your minds, as you read our literature, reach
back to that Dorian shepherd through an atmosphere—his made
ours—as through veils, each veil unfolding a value. So you will
recognise how, from Chaucer down, our literature has panted after
the Mediterranean water-brooks. So through an atmosphere you will
link (let me say) Collins's "Ode to Evening," or Matthew Arnold's
"Strayed Reveller" up to the 'Pervigilium Veneris,' Mr Sturge
Moore's "Sicilian Vine-dresser" up to Theocritus, Pericles'
funeral oration down to Lincoln's over the dead at Gettysburg.
And as I read you just now some part of an English oration in the
Latin manner, so I will conclude with some stanzas in the Greek
manner. They are by Landor—a proud promise by a young writer,
hopeful as I could wish any young learner here to be. The title—</p>

<p>  <i>Corinna, from Athens, to Tanagra</i></p>

<p>  Tanagra! think not I forget<br/>

     Thy beautifully storied streets;<br/>

  Be sure my memory bathes yet<br/>

     In clear Thermodon, and yet greets<br/>

  The blithe and liberal shepherd-boy,<br/>

     Whose sunny bosom swells with joy<br/>

  When we accept his matted rushes<br/>

     Upheav'd with sylvan fruit; away he bounds, and blushes.<br/>
</p>

<p>  A gift I promise: one I see<br/>

     Which thou with transport wilt receive,<br/>

  The only proper gift for thee,<br/>

     Of which no mortal shall bereave<br/>

  In later times thy mouldering walls,<br/>

     Until the last old turret falls;<br/>

  A crown, a crown from Athens won,<br/>

     A crown no god can wear, beside Latona's son.<br/>
</p>

<p>  There may be cities who refuse<br/>

     To their own child the honours due,<br/>

  And look ungently on the Muse;<br/>

     But ever shall those cities rue<br/>

  The dry, unyielding, niggard breast,<br/>

    Offering no nourishment, no rest,<br/>

  To that young head which soon shall rise<br/>

     Disdainfully, in might and glory, to the skies.<br/>
</p>

<p>  Sweetly where cavern'd Dirce flows<br/>

     Do white-arm'd maidens chaunt my lay,<br/>

  Flapping the while with laurel-rose<br/>

     The honey-gathering tribes away;<br/>

  And sweetly, sweetly Attic tongues<br/>

     Lisp your Corinna's early songs;<br/>

  To her with feet more graceful come<br/>

     The verses that have dwelt in kindred breasts at home.<br/>
</p>

<p>  O let thy children lean aslant<br/>

     Against the tender mother's knee,<br/>

  And gaze into her face, and want<br/>

     To know what magic there can be<br/>

  In words that urge some eyes to dance,<br/>

     While others as in holy trance<br/>

  Look up to heaven: be such my praise!<br/>

     Why linger? I must haste, or lose the Delphic bays.<br/>
