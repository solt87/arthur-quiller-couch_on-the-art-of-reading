<p>In our talk, Gentlemen, about Children's Reading we left off upon
a list, drawn up by Mr Holmes in his book 'What Is, and What
Might Be,' of the things that, apart from physical nourishment
and exercise, a child instinctively desires.</p>

<p>He desires<br/>

  (1) to talk and to listen;<br/>

  (2) to act (in the dramatic sense of the word);<br/>

  (3) to draw, paint and model;<br/>

  (4) to dance and sing;<br/>

  (5) to know the why of things;<br/>

  (6) to construct things.<br/>
</p>

<p>Let us scan through this catalogue briefly, in its order.</p>

<p>No. (1). <i>To talk and to listen</i>—Mr Holmes calls this <i>the
communicative instinct.</i> Every child wants to talk with those
about him, or at any rate with his chosen ones—his parents,
brothers, sisters, nurse, governess, gardener, boot-boy (if he
possess these last)—with other children, even if his dear papa
is poor: to tell them what he has been doing, seeing, feeling:
and to listen to what they have to tell him.</p>

<p>Nos. (2), (3), (4). <i>To act</i>—our author calls this the
'dramatic instinct': <i>to draw, paint and model</i>—this the
'artistic instinct'—<i>to dance and sing</i>—this the 'musical
instinct.' But obviously all these are what Aristotle would call
'mimetic' instincts: 'imitative' (in a sense I shall presently
explain); even as No. (2)—acting—like No. (1)—talking and
listening—comes of craving for sympathy. In fact, as we go on,
you will see that these instincts overlap and are not strictly
separable, though we separate them just now for convenience.</p>

<p>No. (5). <i>To know the why of things</i>—the 'inquisitive instinct.'
This, being the one which gives most trouble to parents, parsons,
governesses, conventional schoolmasters—to all grown-up persons
who pretend to know what they don't and are ashamed to tell what
they do—is of course the most ruthlessly repressed.</p>

<p>  'The time is come,' the Infant said,<br/>

  'To talk of many things:<br/>

  Of babies, storks and cabbages<br/>

  And—<br/>
</p>

<p>—having studied the Evangelists' Window facing the family pew—</p>

<p>  And whether cows have wings.'</p>

<p>The answer, in my experience, is invariably stern, and 'in the
negative': in tolerant moments compromising on 'Wait, like a good
boy, and see.'</p>

<p>But we singled out this instinct and discussed it in our last
lecture.</p>

<p>No. (6). <i>To construct things</i>—the 'constructive instinct.' I
quote Mr Holmes here:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  After analysis comes synthesis. The child pulls his toys
  to pieces in order that he may, if possible, reconstruct
  them. The ends that he sets before himself are those which
  Comte Set before the human race—<i>savoir pour prévoir, afin
  de pouvoir: induire pour déduire, afin de construire.</i> The
  desire to make things, to build things up, to control ways
  and means, to master the resources of nature, to put his
  knowledge of her laws and facts to practical use, is strong in
  his soul. Give him a box of bricks, and he will spend hours
  in building and rebuilding houses, churches…. Set him on a
  sandy shore with a spade and a pail, and he will spend hours
  in constructing fortified castles with deep encircling moats.</p>

<p>Again obviously this constructive instinct overlaps with the
imitative ones. Construction, for example, enters into the art of
making mud-pies and has also been applied in the past to great
poetry. If you don't keep a sharp eye in directing this instinct,
it may conceivably end in an "Othello" or in a "Divina Commedia."</p>

</section><section id="chapter-4-2"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>

<p>Without preaching on any of the others, however, I take three of
the six instincts scheduled by Mr Holmes—the three which you
will allow to be almost purely imitative.</p>

<p>They are:</p>

<p>  Acting,<br/>

  Drawing, painting, modelling,<br/>

  Dancing and singing.<br/>
</p>

<p>Now let us turn to the very first page of Aristotle's "Poetics,"
and what do we read?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Epic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and dithyrambic poetry,
  and the greater part of the music of the flute and of the
  lyre, are all, in general, modes of imitation….</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  For as their are persons who represent a number of things
  by colours and drawings, and others vocally, so it is with
  the arts above mentioned. They all imitate by rhythm,
  language, harmony, singly or combined.</p>

<p>Even dancing (he goes on)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  imitates character, emotion and action, by rhythmical
  movement.</p>

<p>Now, having touched on mud-pies, let me say a few words upon
these aesthetic imitative instincts of acting, dancing, singing
before I follow Aristotle into his explanation of the origin of
Poetry, which I think we may agree to be the highest subject of
our Art of Reading and to hold promise of its highest reward.</p>

<p>Every wise mother sings or croons to her child and dances him on
her knee. She does so by sure instinct, long before the small
body can respond or his eyes—always blue at first and
unfathomably aged—return her any answer. It lulls him into the
long spells of sleep so necessary for his first growth. By and
by, when he has found his legs, he begins to skip, and even
before he has found articulate speech, to croon for himself. Pass
a stage, and you find him importing speech, drama, dance,
incantation, into his games with his playmates. Watch a cluster
of children as they enact "Here we go gathering nuts in May"—
eloquent line: it is just what they are doing!—or "Here come
three Dukes a-riding," or "Fetch a pail of water," or "Sally,
Sally Waters":</p>

<p>  Sally, Sally Waters,<br/>

  Sitting in the sand,<br/>

  Rise, Sally—rise, Sally,<br/>

  For a young man.<br/>
</p>

<p>Suitor presented, accepted [I have noted, by the way, that this
game is more popular with girls than with boys]; wedding ceremony
hastily performed—so hastily, it were more descriptive to say
'taken for granted'—within the circle; the dancers, who join
hands and resume the measure, chanting</p>

<p>  Now you are married, we wish you joy—<br/>

  First a girl and then a boy<br/>
</p>

<p>—the order, I suspect, dictated by exigencies of rhyme rather
than of Eugenics, as Dryden confessed that a rhyme had often
helped him to a thought. And yet I don't know; for the incantation
goes on to redress the balance in a way that looks scientific:</p>

<p>  Ten years after, son and daughter,<br/>

  And now—<br/>
</p>

<p>[Practically!]</p>

<p>  And now, Miss Sally, come out of the water.</p>

<p>The players end by supplying the applause which, in these days of
division of labour, is commonly left to the audience.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-4-3"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>

<p>Well, there you have it all: acting, singing, dancing, choral
movement—enlisted ancillary to the domestic drama: and, when you
start collecting evidence of these imitative instincts blent in
childhood the mass will soon amaze you and leave you no room to
be surprised that many learned scholars, on the supposition that
uncivilised man is a child more or less—and at least so much of
child that one can argue through children's practice to his—have
found the historical origin of Poetry itself in these primitive
performances: 'communal poetry' as they call it. I propose to
discuss with you (may be neat term) in a lecture not belonging to
this 'course' the likelihood that what we call specifically 'the
Ballad,' or 'Ballad Poetry,' originated thus. Here is a wider
question. Did all Poetry develop out of this, historically, as a
process in time and in fact? These scholars (among whom I will
instance one of the most learned—Dr Gummere) hold that it did:
and I may take a passage from Dr Gummere's "Beginnings of Poetry"
(p. 95) to show you how they call in the practice of savage races
to support their theory. The Botocudos of South America are—
according to Dr Paul Ehrenreich who has observed them[1]—an
ungentlemanly tribe, 'very low in the social scale.'</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The Botocudos are little better than a leaderless horde, and
  pay scant respect to their chieftain; they live only for their
  immediate bodily needs, and take small thought for the
  morrow, still less for the past. No traditions, no legends, are
  abroad to tell them of their forbears. They still use gestures
  to express feeling and ideas; while the number of words which
  imitate a given sound `is extraordinarily great' An action or
  an object is named by imitating the sound peculiar to it; and
  sounds are doubled to express greater intensity…. To speak is
  <i>aõ</i>; to speak loudly or to sing, is <i>aõ-aõ.</i> And now for their
  aesthetic life, their song, dance, poetry, as described by this
  accurate observer. 'On festal occasions the whole horde meets
  by night round the camp fire for a dance. Men and women
  alternating … form a circle; each dancer lays his arms about
  the necks of his two neighbours, and the entire ring begins to
  turn to the right or to the left, while all the dancers stamp
  strongly and in rhythm the foot that is advanced, and drag
  after it the other foot. Now with drooping heads they press
  closer and closer together; now they widen the circle.
  Throughout the dance resounds a monotonous song to which
  they stamp their feet. Often one can hear nothing but a
  continually repeated <i>kalanî aha!</i>…Again, however, short
  improvised songs, in which we are told the doings of the day,
  the reasons for rejoicing, what not, as "Good hunting," or "Now
  we have something to eat," or "Brandy is good."'</p>

<p>'As to the aesthetic value' of these South American utterances,
Dr Gummere asks in a footnote, 'how far is it inferior to the
sonorous commonplaces of our own verse—say "The Psalm of Life?"'
I really cannot answer that question. Which do you prefer,
Gentlemen?—'Life is real, life is earnest,' or 'Now we have
something to eat'? I must leave you to settle it with the Food
Controller.</p>

<p>The Professor goes on:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  'Now and then, too, an individual begins a song, and is
  answered by the rest in chorus…. <i>They never sing without
  dancing, never dance without singing, and have but one word
  to express both song and dance.</i>'</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  As the unprejudiced reader sees [Dr Gummere proceeds]
  this clear and admirable account confirms the doctrine of
  early days revived with fresh ethnological evidence in the
  writings of Dr Brown and of Adam Smith, that dance, poetry
  and song were once a single and inseparable function, and is
  in itself fatal to the idea of rhythmic prose, of solitary
  recitation, as foundations of poetry…. All poetry is
  communal, holding fast to the rhythm of consent as to the
  one sure fact.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-4-4"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h3>

<p>Now I should tell you, Gentlemen, that I hold such utterances as
this last—whatever you may think of the utterances of the
Botocudos—to be exorbitant: that I distrust all attempts to
build up (say) "Paradise Lost" historically from the yells and
capers of recondite savages. 'Life is real, life is earnest' may
be no better aesthetically (I myself think it a little better)
than 'Now we have something to eat' 'Brandy is good' may rival
Pindar's [Greek: Arioton men udor], and indeed puts what it
contains of truth with more of finality, less of provocation
(though Pindar at once follows up [Greek: Arioton men udor] with
exquisite poetry): but you cannot—truly you cannot—exhibit the
steps which lead up from 'Brandy is good' to such lines as</p>

<p>     Thus with the year<br/>

  Seasons return; but not to me returns<br/>

  Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,<br/>

  Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,<br/>

  Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine.<br/>
</p>

<p>I bend over the learned page pensively, and I seem to see a<br/>

Botocudo Professor—though not high 'in the social scale,' they<br/>

may have such things—visiting Cambridge on the last night of the<br/>

Lent races and reporting of its inhabitants as follows:<br/>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  They pay scant heed to their chiefs: they live only for their
  immediate bodily needs, and take small thought for the
  morrow. On festal occasions the whole horde meets by night
  round the camp fire for a dance. Each dancer lays his arms
  about the necks of his two neighbours, stamping strongly
  with one foot and dragging the other after it. Now with
  drooping heads they press closer and closer together; now
  they widen the circle. Often one can hear nothing but a
  continually repeated <i>kalanî aha,</i> or again one hears short
  improvised songs in which we are told the doings of the day,
  the reasons for rejoicing, what not, as 'Good hunting,' 'Good
  old—'[naming a tribal God], or in former times '<i>Now</i> we shall
  be but a short while,' or '<i>Woemma!</i>' Now and then, too, an
  individual begins a song and is answered by the rest in
  chorus—such as</p>

<p>     For he is an estimable person<br/>

     Beyond possibility of gainsaying.<br/>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The chorus twice repeats this and asseverates that they
  are following a custom common to the flotilla, the
  expeditionary force, and even their rude seats of learning.</p>

<p>And Dr Gummere, or somebody else, comments: 'As the unprejudiced
reader will see, this clear and admirable account confirms our
hypothesis that in communal celebration we have at once the
origin and model of three poems, "The Faerie Queene," "Paradise
Lost" and "In Memoriam," recorded as having been composed by
members of this very tribe.'</p>

<p>Although we have been talking of instincts, we are not concerned
here with the steps by which the child, or the savage, following
an instinct attains to <i>write</i> poetry; but, more modestly, with
the instinct by which the child <i>likes</i> it, and the way in which
he can be best encouraged to read and improve this natural
liking. Nor are we even concerned here to define Poetry. It
suffices our present purpose to consider Poetry as the sort of
thing the poets write.</p>

<p>But obviously if we find a philosopher discussing poetry without
any reference to children, and independently basing it upon the
very same imitative instincts which we have noted in children, we
have some promise of being on the right track.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-4-5"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h3>

<p>So I return to Aristotle. Aristotle (I shall in fairness say)
does not anticipate Dr Gummere, to contradict or refute him; he
may even be held to support him incidentally. But he sticks to
business, and this is what he says ("Poetics," C. IV):</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, and
  these natural causes. First the instinct to imitate is
  implanted in man from his childhood, and in this he differs
  from other animals, being the most imitative of them all. Man
  gets his first learning through imitation, and all men delight
  in seeing things imitated. This is clearly shown by
  experience….</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  To imitate, then, being instinctive in our nature, so too
  we have an instinct for harmony and rhythm, metre being
  manifestly a species of rhythm: and man, being born to these
  instincts and little by little improving them, out of his early
  improvisations created Poetry.</p>

<p>Combining these two instincts, with him, we arrive at <i>harmonious
imitation.</i> Well and good. But what is it we imitate in poetry?—
noble things or mean things? After considering this, putting mean
things aside as unworthy, and voting for the nobler—which must
at the same time be true, since without truth there can be no
real nobility—Aristotle has to ask `In what way true? True to
ordinary life, with its observed defeats of the right by the
wrong? or true, as again instinct tells good men it should be,
<i>universally</i>?' So he arrives at his conclusion that a true thing
is not necessarily truth of fact in a world where truth in fact
is so often belied or made meaningless—not the record that
Alcibiades went somewhere and suffered something—but truth to
the Universal, the superior demand of our conscience. In such a
way only we know that "The Tempest" or "Paradise Lost" or "The
Ancient Mariner" or "Prometheus Unbound" can be truer than any
police report. Yet we know that they are truer in essence, and in
significance, since they appeal to eternal verities—since they
imitate the Universal—whereas the police report chronicles
(faithfully, as in duty bound, even usefully in its way) events
which may, nay must, be significant somehow but cannot at best be
better to us than phenomena, broken ends and shards.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-4-6"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VI</h3>

<p>I return to the child. Clearly in obeying the instinct which I
have tried to illustrate, he is searching to realise himself;
and, as educators, we ought to help this effort—or, at least,
not to hinder it.</p>

<p>Further, if we agree with Aristotle, in this searching to realise
himself through imitation, what will the child most nobly and
naturally imitate? He will imitate what Aristotle calls 'the
Universal,' the superior demand. And does not this bring us back
to consent with what I have been preaching from the start in this
course—that to realise ourselves in <i>What Is</i> not only in degree
transcends mere knowledge and activity, <i>What Knows</i> and <i>What
Does,</i> but transcends it in kind? It is not only what the child
unconsciously longs for: it is that for which (in St Paul's
words) 'the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
together until now'; craving for this (I make you the admission)
as emotionally, as the heart may be thrilled, the breast surge,
the eyes swell with tears, at a note drawn from the violin:
feeling that somewhere, beyond reach, we have a lost sister, and
she speaks to our soul.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-4-7"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VII</h3>

<p>Who, that has been a child, has not felt this surprise of beauty,
the revelation, the call of it?</p>

<p>     The sounding cataract<br/>

     Haunted me like a passion …<br/>
</p>

<p>—yes, or a rainbow on the spray against a cliff; or a vista of
lawns between descending woods; or a vision of fish moving in a
pool under the hazel's shadow? Who has not felt the small
surcharged heart labouring with desire to express it?</p>

<p>I preach to you that the base of all Literature, of all Poetry,
of all Theology, is one, and stands on one rock: <i>the very
highest Universal Truth is something so simple that a child may
understand it.</i> This, surely, was in Jesus' mind when he said `I
thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast
hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed
them unto babes.'</p>

<p>For as the Universe is one, so the individual human souls, that
apprehend it, have no varying values intrinsically, but one equal
value. They vary but in power to apprehend, and this may be more
easily hindered than helped by the conceit begotten of finite
knowledge. I shall even dare to quote of this Universal Truth,
the words I once hardily put into the mouth of John Wesley
concerning divine Love: 'I see now that if God's love reach up to
every star and down to every poor soul on earth, it must be
vastly simple; so simple that all dwellers on Earth may be
assured of it—as all who have eyes may be assured of the planet
shining yonder at the end of the street—and so vast that all
bargaining is below it, and they may inherit it without
considering their deserts.' I believe this to be strictly and
equally true of the appeal which Poetry makes to each of us,
child or man, in his degree. As Johnson said of Gray's "Elegy,"
it 'abounds with images which find a mirror in every mind, and
with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo.' It exalts
us through the best of us, by telling us something new yet not
strange, something that we <i>recognise,</i> something that we too
have known, or surmised, but had never the delivering speech to
tell. 'There is a pleasure in poetic pains,' says Wordsworth:
but, Gentlemen, if you have never felt the travail, yet you have
still to understand the bliss of deliverance.</p>

<p>If, then, you consent with me thus far in theory, let us now
drive at practice. You have (we will say) a class of thirty or
forty in front of you. We will assume that they know <i>a-b, ab,</i>
can at least spell out their words. You will choose a passage for
them, and you will not (if you are wise) choose a passage from
"Paradise Lost": your knowledge telling you that "Paradise Lost"
was written, late in his life, by a great <i>virtuoso,</i> and older
men (of whom I, sad to say, am one) assuring you that to taste
the Milton of "Paradise Lost" a man must have passed his
thirtieth year. You take the early Milton: you read out this, for
instance, from "L'Allegro":</p>

<p>  Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee<br/>

  Jest and youthful Jollity,<br/>

  Quips, and Cranks, and wanton wiles,<br/>

  Nods and Becks, and wreathed Smiles<br/>

  Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,<br/>

  And love to live in dimple sleek;<br/>

  Sport that wrinkled Care derides,<br/>

  And Laughter holding both his sides….<br/>
</p>

<p>Go on: just read it to them. They won't know who Hebe was, but
you can tell them later. The metre is taking hold of them (in my
experience the metre of "L'Allegro" can be relied upon to grip
children) and anyway they can see `Laughter holding both his
sides': they recognise it as if they saw the picture. Go on
steadily:</p>

<p>  Come, and trip it as ye go,<br/>

  On the light fantastick toe;<br/>

  And in thy right hand lead with thee<br/>

  The Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty;<br/>

  And, if I give thee honour due,<br/>

  Mirth, admit me of thy crew—<br/>
</p>

<p>Do not pause and explain what a Nymph is, or why Liberty is the
'Mountain Nymph'! Go on reading: the Prince has always to break
through briers to kiss the Sleeping Beauty awake. Go on with the
incantation, calling him, persuading him, that he is the Prince
and she is worth it. Go on reading—</p>

<p>  Mirth, admit me of thy crew,<br/>

  To live with her, and live with thee,<br/>

  In unreprovéd pleasures free;<br/>

  To hear the lark begin his flight,<br/>

  And singing startle the dull night,<br/>

  From his watch-towre in the skies,<br/>

  Till the dappled dawn doth rise.<br/>
</p>

<p>At this point—still as you read without stopping to explain, the
child certainly feels that he is being led to something. He knows
the lark: but the lark's 'watch-towre'—he had never thought of
that: and 'the dappled dawn'-yes that's just <i>it,</i> now he comes
to think:</p>

<p>  Then to come, in spite of sorrow,<br/>

  And at my window bid good-morrow,<br/>

  Through the sweet-briar or the vine<br/>

  Or the twisted eglantine;<br/>

  While the cock with lively din<br/>

  Scatters the rear of Darkness thin;<br/>

  And to the stack, or the barn door,<br/>

  Stoutly struts his dames before:<br/>

  Oft listening how the hounds and horn<br/>

  Cheerily rouse the slumbering Morn,<br/>

  From the side of some hoar hill,<br/>

  Through the high wood echoing shrill:<br/>

  Sometime walking, not unseen,<br/>

  By hedgerow elms on hillocks green,<br/>

  Right against the eastern gate,<br/>

  Where the great sun begins his state,<br/>

  Robed in flames and amber light,<br/>

  The clouds in thousand liveries dight;<br/>

  While the ploughman, near at hand,<br/>

  Whistles o'er the furrow'd land,<br/>

  And the milkmaid singeth blithe,<br/>

  And the mower whets his sithe,<br/>

  And every shepherd tells his tale<br/>

  Under the hawthorn in the dale.<br/>
</p>

<p>Don't stop (I say) to explain that Hebe was (for once) the
legitimate daughter of Zeus and, as such, had the privilege to
draw wine for the gods. Don't even stop, just yet, to explain who
the gods were. Don't discourse on amber, otherwise ambergris;
don't explain that 'gris' in this connexion doesn't mean
'grease'; don't trace it through the Arabic into Noah's Ark;
don't prove its electrical properties by tearing up paper into
little bits and attracting them with the mouth-piece of your pipe
rubbed on your sleeve. Don't insist philologically that when
every shepherd 'tells his tale' he is not relating an anecdote
but simply keeping tally of his flock.</p>

<p>Just go on reading, as well as you can; and be sure that when the
children get the thrill of it, for which you wait, they will be
asking more questions, and pertinent ones, than you are able to
answer.</p>

</section><section id="chapter-4-9"><h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IX</h3>

<p>This advice, to be sure, presupposes of the teacher himself some
capacity of reading aloud, and reading aloud is not taught in our
schools. In our Elementary Schools, in which few of the pupils
contemplate being called to Holy Orders or to the Bar, it is
practised, indeed, but seldom taught as an art. In our Secondary
and Public Schools it is neither taught nor practised: as I know
to my cost—and you, to yours, Gentlemen, on whom I have had to
practise.</p>

<p>But let the teacher take courage. First let him read a passage
'at the long breath'—as the French say—aloud, and persuasively
as he can. Now and then he may pause to indicate some particular
beauty, repeating the line before he proceeds. But he should be
sparing of these interruptions. When Laughter, for example, is
already 'holding both his sides' it cannot be less than
officious, a work of supererogation, to stop and hold them for
him; and he who obeys the counsel of perfection will read
straight to the end and then recur to particular beauties. Next
let him put up a child to continue with the tale, and another and
another, just as in a construing class. While the boy is reading,
the teacher should <i>never</i> interrupt: he should wait, and return
afterwards upon a line that has been slurred or wrongly
emphasised. When the children have done reading he should invite
questions on any point they have found puzzling: it is with the
operation of poetry on <i>their</i> minds that his main business lies.
Lastly, he may run back over significant points they have missed.</p>

<p>'And is that all the method?'-Yes, that is all the method. 'So
simple as that?'-Yes, even so simple as that, and (I claim) even
so wise, seeing that it just lets the author—Chaucer or
Shakespeare or Milton or Coleridge—have his own way with the
young plant—just lets them drop 'like the gentle rain from
heaven,' and soak in.</p>

<p>  The moving Moon went up the sky,<br/>

  And no where did abide:<br/>

  Softly she was going up,<br/>

  And a star or two beside.<br/>
</p>

<p>Do you really want to chat about <i>that</i>? Cannot you trust it?</p>

<p>  The stars were dim, and thick the night,<br/>

  The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;<br/>

  From the sails the dew did drip—<br/>

  Till clomb above the eastern bar<br/>

  The hornéd Moon, with one bright star<br/>

  Within the nether tip.<br/>
</p>

<p><i>Must</i> you tell them that for the Moon to hold a star anywhere
within her circumference is an astronomical impossibility? Very
well, then; tell it. But tell it afterwards, and put it away
quietly. For the quality of Poetry is not strained. Let the rain
soak; then use your hoe, and gently; and still trust Nature; by
which, I again repeat to you, all spirit attracts all spirit as
inevitably as all matter attracts all matter.</p>

<p>'Strained.' I am glad that memory flew just here to the word of
Portia's: for it carries me on to a wise page of Dr Corson's, and
a passage in which, protesting against the philologers who cram
our children's handbooks with irrelevant information that but
obscures what Chaucer or Shakespeare <i>mean,</i> he breaks out in
Chaucer's own words:</p>

<p>     Thise cookes, how they stampe, and streyne, and grynde,<br/>

     And turnen substaunce into accident!<br/>
</p>

<p>(Yes, and make the accident the substance!)—as he insists that
the true subject of literary study is the author's meaning; and
the true method a surrender of the mind to that meaning, with
what Wordsworth calls 'a wise passiveness':</p>

<p>  The eye—it cannot choose but see;<br/>

  We cannot bid the ear be still;<br/>

  Our bodies feel, where'er they be,<br/>

  Against or with our will.<br/>
</p>

<p>  Nor less I deem that there are Powers<br/>

  Which of themselves our minds impress;<br/>

  That we can feed this mind of ours<br/>

  In a wise passiveness.<br/>
</p>

<p>  Think you, 'mid all this mighty sum<br/>

  Of things for ever speaking,<br/>

  That nothing of itself will come,<br/>

  But we must still be seeking?<br/>
</p>

<p>I have been talking to-day about children; and find that most of
the while I have been thinking, if but subconsciously, of poor
children. Now, at the end, you may ask 'Why, lecturing here at
Cambridge, is he preoccupied with poor children who leave school
at fourteen and under, and thereafter read no poetry?'…Oh, yes!
I know all about these children and the hopeless, wicked waste;
these with a common living-room to read in, a father tired after
his day's work, and (for parental encouragement) just the two
words 'Get out!' A Scots domine writes in his log:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I have discovered a girl with a sense of humour. I asked my
  qualifying class to draw a graph of the attendance at a village
  kirk. 'And you must explain away any rise or fall,' I said.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Margaret Steel had a huge drop one Sunday, and her explanation
  was 'Special Collection for Missions.' Next Sunday the
  Congregation was abnormally large: Margaret wrote 'Change of
  Minister.'… Poor Margaret! When she is fourteen, she will go
  out into the fields, and in three years she will be an ignorant
  country bumpkin.</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Robert Campbell (a favourite pupil) left the school to-day. He
  had reached the age-limit…. Truly it is like death: I stand
  by a new made grave, and I have no hope of a resurrection.
  Robert is dead.</p>

<p>Precisely because I have lived on close terms with this, and the
wicked waste of it, I appeal to you who are so much more
fortunate than this Robert or this Margaret and will have far
more to say in the world, to think of them—how many they are. I
am not sentimentalising. When an Elementary Schoolmaster spreads
himself and tells me he looks upon every child entering his
school as a potential Lord Chancellor, I answer that, as I
expect, so I should hope, to die before seeing the world a
Woolsack. Jack cannot ordinarily be as good as his master; if he
were, he would be a great deal better. You have given Robert a
vote, however, and soon you will have to give it to Margaret. Can
you not give them also, in their short years at school, something
to sustain their souls in the long Valley of Humiliation?</p>

<p>Do you remember this passage in "The Pilgrim's Progress"—as the
pilgrims passed down that valley?</p>

<p>  Now as they were going along and talking, they espied a<br/>

  Boy feeding his Father's Sheep. The Boy was in very mean<br/>

  Cloaths, but of a very fresh and well-favoured<br/>

  Countenance, and as he sate by himself he Sung. Hark, said<br/>

  Mr Greatheart, to what the Shepherd's Boy saith.<br/>
</p>

<p>Well, it was a very pretty song, about Contentment.</p>

<p>     He that is down need fear no fall<br/>

     He that is low, no Pride:<br/>

     He that is humble ever shall<br/>

     Have God to be his Guide.<br/>
</p>

<p>But I care less for its subject than for the song. Though life
condemn him to live it through in the Valley of Humiliation, I
want to hear the Shepherd Boy singing.</p>
